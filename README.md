# hello-world

Hey, humanoid! I'm Michelle, I writer/maker who likes narrative-driven games with a touch of horror.

This repository is just me working through the GitHub guide and trying to set up my first repository. I'll probably use this space to test things, remind myself how stuff works, and maybe to store any notes, ideas and resources.
